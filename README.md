# dotfiles

Install script for setting up my development environment on a new machine.  Includes my favorite:

* Program installs for Mac and Linux
* Shell setup with extensions (I use zsh, but bash is also supported here)
* vim, tmux setup with extensions
* etc

To install, just run `install.sh`.  Run `install.sh --help` for a full list of options.
